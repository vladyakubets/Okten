<p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and
    last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is
    known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google,

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time,
    HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[9] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future
    developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not
    to renew it.[10]

    The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop
    in June 2004,[11] focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers,[12]
    including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for
    continuing work on HTML.[13] Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that
    position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.[14] The two specifications were later
    merged to form HTML5.[15] The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML
    working group of the W3C in 2007.The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World

    WHATWG's Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C's first public working draft of the specification
    on 22 January 2008.[4]</p>

<p id="lastp">While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two technologies are very different.
    Both include
    features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using Scalable Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 on its
    own cannot be used for animation or interactivity – it must be supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many
    Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML5 (see Comparison of HTML5 and Flash). HTML5's interactive
    capabilities became a topic of mainstream media attention around April 2010[16][17][18][19] after Apple Inc.'s
    then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled "Thoughts on Flash" in which he concluded that "Flash is no longer
    necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era,
